# landing-page

This project is made using HTML, CSS. 
This is to get hands on the learnt concepts on HTML, CSS and flexbox

I have divided the page into 4 sections and a footer

I will be working on each section starting from section 1

Section 1 contains a Header with links and logo and contents which breifs the company motto
Used flexbox to implement the list in the header , auto margin to place the logo at the start
Used flexbox in the contents section as well

Section 2 contais a small header to the section and a list of services provided.
I have used flexbox to list the serives in horizontal row.

Section 3 containes a quote text and author. 

Section 4 contains some text and a sign up button which are aligned side by side with flexbox
