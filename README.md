# landing-page

This project is made using HTML, CSS. 
This is to get hands on the learnt concepts on HTML, CSS and flexbox

I have divided the page into 4 sections and a footer

I will be working on each section starting from section 1

Section 1 contains a Header with links and logo and contents which breifs the company motto
Used flexbox to implement the list in the header , auto margin to place the logo at the start
Used flexbox in the contents section as well
